no point to do client server, and this is more fun
then i would send data over.
ssh handles it all
not light weight at all, but then i shouldnt use golang
this seems fun

possible computers
- KataGo (looks good)
- Leela Zero (confusing, doesnt seem to have data, and out dated)
- Pachi
- Fuego

dont think i need the whole protocol. at least not now
maybe for ai
but just moves can be stored special, and hint at that

storing row/col as ints
could use 1 string, but not as smart for parsing/using
could store as char/number, but still not as smart

not really using protocol, but dont seem to need it
will use it i guesss when making ai interaction

GORM, ent, but after looking, base is good enough
